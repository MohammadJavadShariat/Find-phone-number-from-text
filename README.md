# Find-phone-number-from-text
Hello!
This program is made to recognize the mobile number from the text.
First, you will be asked to enter your text and enter.
Then the program separates the non-duplicate mobile numbers in the text and shows you that number along with the operator.
If the operator is also unknown, the program says that the operator is unknown.
However, if there is no mobile number in the text, the message "phone number is not available" will be givenðŸ‘Œ
